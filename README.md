Use it to perform the following tasks. Markdown documentation is encouraged.

ðŸ“Œ Task Levels

The challenge is divided into three levels of increasing complexity.

ðŸ”° Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
âœ… Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Utilize libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to load and visualize the dataset.
Display sample images from each category to understand the data distribution.
Generate summary statistics for pixel values to comprehend data characteristics.

âš¡ Level 2: Basic Classification Model
âœ… Develop a classifier using Logistic Regression to predict the category of clothing items.
Preprocess and normalize the data
Split the dataset into test and training subsets
Implement algorithm using a library of your choice
Train the model and evaluate accuracy and loss metrics
Implement Explainable AI techniques to interpret model decisions and feature importance

ðŸš€ Level 3: Neural Network Implementation
âœ… Construct and train a simple neural network to classify images into different types of clothing
Design a neural network architecture with input, hidden, and output layers
Utilize appropriate activation functions
Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on a separate validation set.
Evaluate accuracy and loss metrics
